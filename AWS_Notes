IAM (Global AWS service)

1. We are working at CSPG team 
2. Currently 4 testers workining in CSPG team 
3. We need to provide for CI/CD pipeline READ Access for testers  (Static permissions)
4. We created IAM(Identity and Access Management) group. But Users and Permission still missing. 
5. AWS has 2 types of policies: 1) AWS Managed(Custom) and 2) Inline Policies-Customer managed (We build)
6. We use "AWS policy generator" to build our own inline policies
7. First rule of IAM is giving Granular Access (Give only whatever necessary, Don't give wide open permissions)

IAM Policy:

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html


1. Default value of Effect is Deny 

KISS --> Keep it Simple,Stupid 
This is the Best Practice.
Optimal access rights
Version is always: 2012-10-17
READ access: GET/LIST/DESCRIBE
DEV/PROD Parity (You can make mistakes in DEV but never in PROD)

12-Factor app:
is designed for continous deployment by keeping the gap between development and production small.
